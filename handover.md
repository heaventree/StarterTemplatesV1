# StarterTemplates.com Clone Project Handover

## Project Purpose
This project is a comprehensive clone of StarterTemplates.com, a platform for discovering and managing website templates. The goal is to create an exact replica of the original site's functionality and appearance, with plans to implement a full-featured CMS backend according to a multi-phase roadmap spanning from Q2 2025 to Q1 2026.

The application consists of:
- A React.js frontend with template discovery and filtering
- A Node.js/Express backend with REST API
- PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- Comprehensive task management system for project roadmap

## Development Timeline and Accomplishments

### Prior to Current Session
- Created initial frontend implementation with template discovery UI
- Implemented 280 templates with proper categorization and card layout
- Added responsive design and filtering functionality
- Built task management UI for displaying the CMS roadmap
- Set up initial in-memory storage system

### Current Session (April 26, 2025)

#### 12:38 AM - Database Infrastructure Setup
- Created a PostgreSQL database for the project
- Generated database environment variables and connection settings
- Created server/db.ts for database connection handling

#### 12:39 AM - Database Schema Implementation
- Updated shared/schema.ts to include explicit relations
- Added relation definitions for users, tasks, and comments
- Ensured proper foreign key references and constraints

#### 12:40 AM - Database Storage Implementation
- Created storage.ts.db file with DatabaseStorage class implementation
- Implemented all CRUD operations for users, templates, pageBuilders, tasks, and taskComments
- Maintained consistent interface with original in-memory storage

#### 12:41 AM - Database Seeding
- Implemented db-seed.ts for populating database with initial data
- Added seed data for users (with bcrypt password hashing)
- Added seed data for page builders, templates, and tasks
- Organized task seed data according to CMS roadmap phases

#### 12:42 AM - Database Migration
- Configured drizzle.config.ts for schema push
- Successfully pushed schema to database using Drizzle ORM
- Ran database seeding script to populate initial data

#### 12:43 AM - Storage Transition
- Replaced in-memory storage with database storage
- Fixed circular import issues in storage implementation
- Restarted application to use database-backed storage
- Verified API endpoints working correctly with database storage

## Current Status
The application has been successfully migrated from in-memory storage to PostgreSQL database with the following components functioning:

1. **Database Schema**: Properly modeled with relations between entities
2. **API Endpoints**: All working correctly with database storage
3. **Roadmap Tasks**: 17 tasks from CMS roadmap in database with proper metadata
4. **Templates**: Currently 3 example templates in database (down from 280 in memory storage)
5. **Authentication**: Basic auth implementation with bcrypt for password hashing

## Next Steps
1. **Template Migration**: Transfer all 280 templates from the in-memory storage to the database
2. **Authentication System**: Implement JWT-based authentication system (Phase 1 task)
3. **User Management**: Create user profile management UI as specified in roadmap
4. **Template Management**: Implement template CRUD operations UI
5. **Continue CMS Implementation**: Follow the roadmap phases to implement remaining features

## Known Issues
- Only 3 sample templates in database instead of all 280
- Role-based access control needs implementation
- Frontend needs updating to handle user authentication

## Environment Setup
The project uses PostgreSQL database with connection details stored in environment variables. The database schema is managed using Drizzle ORM with automatic migrations. The application runs on port 5000 and serves both frontend and backend.
